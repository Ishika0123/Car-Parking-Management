# Car-parking management
Car Parking Management Project 

I have created a parking management system in C++ that features a text-based menu interface that showcases basic menu-driven programming, input handling, and data tracking. In this, users can park four types of vehicles up to a limit of 50 each. As the vehicles are parked, parking fees are accumulated contributing to a total collected amount. The system displays total earnings and vehicle counts for each type. An option to reset all data is also available to clear all the records.
The tech stack that I used is C++ with a simple switch case implementation.
